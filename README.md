# GAN
# Distribution of Age for eICU Patients

The goal of this project is to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to reproduce the tabular data found at:

https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jlab_datascience_data/blob/main/eICU_age.npy

This dataset includes the ages of critical care patients seen across intensive care units in the United States. The original data is from the [eICU Collaborative Research Database](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/about/eicu/).

## Objective

Implement a GAN in Python to model the distribution of patient ages. Implementation should:

- Coordinate the generator and discriminator models
- Train the GAN on the provided dataset
- Generate synthetic age data
- Compare the generated distribution to the real data
- Include figures/plots to show training performance and distribution alignment
